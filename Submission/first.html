		<h1>Fundamentals of HTML</h1>
		<h2>Text Formatting</h2>
		<p>A paragraph with <i> text that are emphasized</i> and <b>some important words.</b> Followed by some <mark>highlighted words.</mark> Feel free to add any other text that appeals to you.</p>
		<pre>
   This is some text 
   this is laid out exactly as
   Laid out at code level without any additional 
   markup
		</pre>
		<h2>Special Characters</h2>
		<p>
		    The browser thinks &lt; is a programming character. Also &gt;. The browser also ignores any line breaks<br>
			in your code and any &nbsp;&nbsp; white space. To include these you need to use special characters aka html character entities. There are other entities available such as &euro; and &amp;
			
		</p>
		<h2>Links</h2>
		<p>A web page without any links is a unique and peculiar find. You can have links to seperate sites such as <a href="https://www.leedsbeckett.ac.uk/">Leeds Beckett.</a> Links to other pages of the <a href="https://www.leedsbeckett.ac.uk/international-students/">same site.</a> Links to another point in the <a href="#top">same page.</a></p>
		<h2>Images</h2>
		<pre>
					<img src="image.png"></pre>
		<p>This image is stored on this server in an image sub-folder<br><br>
			I hope you added an alt attribute to support screen readers<br><br>
			Why not see what happens if you try to validate your code using W3C Markup Validation Service without the alt attribute included. If you right click on your page and chose inspect or view source you can check your code and see the HTML comment you have added just inside the body tag<br><br><br></p>
			Notes:<br>
			<ul>
				<li>The final para is automatically word wrapped by the browser and does not contain a line break</li>
				<li>The image has been prepared as small 100*100 image prior to inclusion on the page</li>
				<li>To create a link to another page a simple second page will be needed-put a return link on that page</li>
				<li>To test intrapage link you will probably need to resize the browser so that a narrow vertical window</li>
			</ul>
